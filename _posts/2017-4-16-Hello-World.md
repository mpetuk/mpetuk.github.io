So this is week #2 of my Metis adventure. Two weeks ago I walked away from  my well-paid and otherwise handsome job at the well-established company straight into the bootcamp. A data science one, not fitness as some of my friends presumed. No time to waist(e)! (Ba-dam-chhh)

Anyway. It was an interesting week. I am playing with cool kids and we have cool toys and everything around us is just the code (hello Neo!)
