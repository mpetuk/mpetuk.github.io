“Luther is a brilliant but emotionally impulsive detective who is tormented by the dark side of humanity while hunting down murderers.”

I love it that Metis names our projects after characters of different drama series and that degree of drama raises, appropriately, each week. As such, we went from “Law and Order SVU” (week 1) to “Luther” (week 2)  to “The Wire” (week 3).
